Chain Run Instructions
	- Each RUN command will execute the command on the top writable layer of the container, then commit the container as a new image.
	- The new image is used for the next step in the dockerfile. So each RUN instruction will create a new image layer
	- It is recommended to chain the RUN instructions in the dockerfile to reduce the number of image layers it creates

####
FROM debian:jessie
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git
RUN apt-get install -y vim
####

When chained the dockerfile from above is changed to below:

####
FROM debian:jessie
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    vim
####


Sort multi-line arguments alphanumerically
	- This will help you avoid duplication of packages and make the list much easier to update

####
FROM debian:jessie
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    python \
    vim
####


CMD instructions
	- CMD instruction specifies what command you want to run when the container starts up
	- If we don't specify CMD instruction in the dockerfile, docker will use the default command defined in the base image
	- The CMD instruction doesn't run when building the image, it only runs when the container starts up
	- You can specify the command in either exec form which is preferred or in shell form

####
FROM debian:jessie
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    python \
    vim
CMD ["echo", "hello world"]
