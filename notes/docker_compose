Docker Compose

Seperate tool that gets installed w/ docker

Used to start up multiple docker containers at the same time

Automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to 'docker run'

docker-compose v1 vs v2 vs v3

**if you're using version 2 of docker-compse files, you must specify "version: 2" at the top and everything is nested inside "services: " & version 3 must include "version: 3" at the top.**

**version 2 does not use links**

**version 3 enabled docker swarm**
