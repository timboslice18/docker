#Map port 80 on the docker host to port 5000 on the webapp
docker run -p 80:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp

with the -p, by default that means it can be reached on any nic on the docker host

To limit that, add the IP address in front of the ports:
docker run -p 192.168.1.5:80:5000 kodekloud/simple-webapp

a Capital P option (-P) automatically publishes port on the container. It is defined in the EXPOSE instruction in the Dockerfile

You can also expose port in the docker run command:
docker run -P --expose=8080 kokekloud/simple-webapp

docker inspect can show exposed ports

Docker uses IPtables to implement port mapping

#lists port mappings created by docker
iptables -t nat -S DOCKER
